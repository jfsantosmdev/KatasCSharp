# Fizz Buzz

FizzBuzz is a group words game where players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "Fizz", any number divisible by five with the word "Buzz" and if is divisible by three and five with the words "Fizz Buzz"

Examples:

- 1 => 1
- 2 => 2
- 3 => Fizz
- 4 => 4
- 5 => Buzz
- 6 => Fizz
- 7 => 7
- 8 => 8
- 9 => Fizz
- 10 => Buzz
- 11 => 11
- 12 => Fizz
- 13 => 13
- 14 => 14
- 15 => Fizz Buzz

# Stop Spinning My Words

Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

Examples: 

- "Hey fellow warriors"  => "Hey wollef sroirraw" 
- "This is a test" => "This is a test"
- "This is another test" => "This is rehtona test"

# Is Pandram?
A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. 

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.

Example: 
- "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" => true

# Sum of odd numbers

Given the triangle of consecutive odd numbers:

1
3	5
7	9	11
13	15	17	19
21	23	25	27	29
...

Calculate the sum of the numbers in the nth row of this triangle (starting at index 1) e.g.: (Input --> Output)

1 ->  1
2 -> 3 + 5 = 8
